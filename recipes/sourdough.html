    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a relatively easy sourdough recipe that I showcase on my Instagram account, @breaddeadredemption
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g 100% hydration dark rye and whole wheat sourdough starter</li>
        <li>296g strong bread flour like ABC+</li>
        <li>96g medium coarseness high-protein whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>290g water (25g reserved)</li>
        <li>12g fine sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-large mixing bowl, combine the flour and 265g of water. Mix until fully incorporated. Allow to autolyse (rest and hydrate) for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the sourdough starter to the autolyse dough. I like to push my fingertips through the starter and into the dough to help incorporate it.</li>
        <li>Begin stretching the dough from under one side, folding it over on itself, and rotating it 90 degrees. Ensure that the flour is thoroughly hydrated and no dry spots remain </li>
        <li>Repeat the folding process for at least eight folds, rubbing any dry spots you encounter between your fingers to hydrate them.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
